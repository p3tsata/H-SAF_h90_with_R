# H-SAF H90 Data Downloader and Visualizer

This repository contains an R script that downloads, processes, and visualizes H-SAF H90 accumulated precipitation rate data for a specified region and time period. It retrieves data from the H-SAF FTP server, processes the netCDF files, and generates maps and GeoTIFF files of precipitation over the specified area.

## Introduction

The H-SAF (EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management) provides satellite-derived data products related to precipitation and soil moisture. The **H90 product** is the accumulated precipitation rate derived from Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites.

This R script automates the process of downloading H90 data for a specified time period and region, processes the netCDF files, and visualizes it using maps. The outputs include PNG images of the precipitation maps and GeoTIFF files for further geospatial analysis.

## Features

- **Automated Data Download**: Fetches H90 netCDF files from the H-SAF FTP server for a specified time range.
- **Data Processing**: Extracts and processes precipitation data from netCDF files.
- **Visualization**: Creates precipitation maps over a user-defined region using the `tmap` package.
- **GeoTIFF Generation**: Outputs processed data as GeoTIFF files for GIS applications.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Easily adjust time periods, regions, and visualization settings.

## Requirements

- **R** version 3.6 or higher.
- **R Packages**:
  - RCurl
  - stringr
  - lubridate
  - ncdf4
  - tmap
  - sf
  - raster

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/p3tsata/H-SAF_h90_with_R.git
   
2. **Install Required R Packages**
   Install the necessary R packages if they are not already installed:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("RCurl", "stringr", "lubridate", "ncdf4", "tmap", "sf", "raster"))

3. **Set Up the Working Directory**
   Ensure that your working directory is set to the location of the cloned repository or adjust the paths in the script     accordingly.
## Usage
1. **Set Up FTP Account**
  - To access the H-SAF FTP server, you need a valid username and password. If you do not have an account, please register at H-SAF User Registration - https://hsaf.meteoam.it/User/Register
  - Set FTP Credentials
In the script, replace the placeholders with your FTP username and password:
```r
ftp_user <- "your_username"
ftp_pass <- "your_password"
```

3. **Define Time Period**
Set the start and end dates for the data you wish to download. The dates should be in the format YYYYMMDDHH.
```r
from_date <- "2024040100"  # Start date (inclusive)
to_date   <- "2024040200"  # End date (inclusive)
```
Note: The H90 data is available for the last two months.

4. **Define Region**
Provide the path to a shapefile (.shp) that defines the region of interest. The script uses this shapefile to clip the data and generate maps for the specified area.
```r
shp_file_path <- "./shp_file/BgBorder_region.shp"
```
nsure that the shapefile and its associated files (.dbf, .shx, etc.) are in the specified directory.

5. **Run the Script**
Execute the R script in your R environment:

## Output

The script will perform the following actions:

### Download Data

Downloads the H90 netCDF files for the specified time period from the H-SAF FTP server and saves them in the `./d_files/` directory.

### Process Data

Unzips and processes the netCDF files to extract the accumulated precipitation rate data.

### Generate Maps

Creates maps of the precipitation data overlaid on the specified region using the `tmap` package. The maps are saved as PNG images in the `./png/` directory.

### Generate GeoTIFFs

Saves the processed precipitation data as GeoTIFF files in the `./gtiff/` directory for further geospatial analysis.

### Output Directories

- **Downloaded Files**: `./d_files/` - Contains the downloaded and unzipped netCDF files.
- **PNG Images**: `./png/` - Contains the generated precipitation maps as PNG images.
- **GeoTIFF Files**: `./gtiff/` - Contains the precipitation data as GeoTIFF files.

## Notes

### Data Availability

The H90 data is typically available for the last two months. Ensure your specified time period falls within the available data range.

### Projections

The script handles coordinate transformations between the SEVIRI projection and WGS84 (EPSG:4326).

### Performance

Processing large time periods or high-resolution data may require significant computational resources.

### Error Handling

The script does basic checks for directory existence and file existence but may require additional error handling for robustness in different environments.
